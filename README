About:

    This is an Inventory Program I Created,
    Although I Need To Rewrite it, it is not
    That Bad

How-It-Works:

    if C:\Users\myhou\AppData\Local\Programs\AssetFlow is not a folder it creates it it uses a json file to store data.
    If there is a login pass already created it will ask for the login, if not it will ask you to create a pass. 
    Once you login you will be at the main menu, you will have 5 options (Create a new item, Update an item, Delete and item, x - y, Logout)

Commands:

    Create a new item: Adds a new item to the inventory
    Update an item: Updates an item in the inventory
    Delete an item: Deletes an item from the inventory
    x - y: Specify the low ID and High ID and it will 
    give you everything in between including the low and high
    Logout: Exits the program
